Come Fishing


Vishal and Piyush like to fish. 
They walk to the pond.Vishal


Simon says,Vishal
“Come fishing, Shreya.”


Shreya does not want to fish.


She tries to stop the boys. 
She doesn’t want them to hurt the fish.


Shreya worries about the fish. 
Will the boys catch them?


Simon feels a tug. 
Piyush feels a tug, too.


They try to land the fish. 


The fishing rods break.


The fish tricked the boys!
