My Ball


I have a ball.I love my ball.I love to kick my ball.I love to kick my ball. 
I can kick it far.Where is my ball?I do not see my ball.


Where did my ball go?I see my ball! 
It is high in the sky!It is flying through the clouds!It is flying into space!My ball is on the moon. 
Now I need a new ball!
