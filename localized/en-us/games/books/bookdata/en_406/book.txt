Animals of the Sea


Many animals live in the sea! 
What kind would you like to be?Would you like to have eight arms like an octopus?Would you like to be orange like this fish?Would you like to jump and play like dolphins?Maybe you want a hard shell like a sea turtle?Would you like to glide through the water like a manta ray?Or rest on the beach like a starfish? 
Do you like to be in the warm sun?
