"Can you tell me what happened?”
MaddiMamtather asked. 
“I don't want to,”

Maddie's father handed Maddie some crayons. 


First, she drew a red block. 
“This,”Mamta
she explained,
“is the brick I tripped over on my way to lunch.”


Next, Maddie took a green crayon. 
She drew a picture of a boy. 
“This,”
explained Maddie,
“is the mean boy who laughed at me when I fell down!”


Maddie took a yellow crayon and drew more. 
“This is my cookie,”
Maddie said. 
“It fell out of my lunch box when I tripped.”


With a purple crayon, Maddie drew a bird. 
In the bird's mouth was Maddie's cookie. 
“Then a bird stole my cookie!”
said Maddie. 
“I wanted to eat that cookie,”
she said. 


Then Maddie drew a picture of her teacher. 
“Miss Laxmi helped me up. 
She gave me her cookie from her lunch.”


Maddie's father smiled. 
“See? 
Your day wasn't all bad,”
he said. 
“And look! 
You are a very good artist!” 


Maddie smiled. 
She forgot to be mad and kept drawing. 
She drew the flowers she had scowled at. 
She drew their bicycle and a tree and a frog. 
Maybe it would be a good day after all.
