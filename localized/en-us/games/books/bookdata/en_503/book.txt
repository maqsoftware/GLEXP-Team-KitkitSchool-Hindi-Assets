Don’t Get Mad, Mamta


School ended and all the boys and girls ran outside. 
Everyone laughed and played except for Mamta. 
Mamta was mad! 

Mamta's father smiled as he took Maddie home through a field of flowers on his bicycle. 
Mamta didn't smile at the pretty flowers. 
Mamta was so mad! 

When they got home, Mamta's father waved hello to the monkeys on the roof. 
Mamta didn't say hello. 
Mamta was mad. 
She scowled at the monkeys. 
Mamta yelled,
“Get off our house!" 

Mamta's father tried to make his daughter feel better. 
“Here, Mamta”
he said,
"drink some nice cool milk.”
"Don't want any,”
Mamta yelled. 
But Mamta drank the milk anyway. 
Mamta felt a little less mad. 

“How about a sweet snack?”
Mamta's father. 
“No, no, no!”
shouted Mamta. 
But her father gave her something to eat anyway. 
Mamta ate the sweet and felt a little better. 

“Why are you so unhappy, Mamta?”
Mamta's father asked.
“Are you hurt?”
he asked. 
“No,”
said Mamta.
“I'm MAD! 
I had a bad day at school.”

"Can you tell me what happened?”
Mamta's father asked. 
“I don't want to,”
said Mamta.
“Can you draw what happened?”
he asked. 
Mamta's father handed Mamta some crayons. 


First, she drew a red block. 
“This,”Mamta
she explained,
“is the brick I tripped over on my way to lunch.”


Next, Mamta took a green crayon. 
She drew a picture of a boy. 
“This,”
explained Mamta,
“is the mean boy who laughed at me when I fell down!”


Mamta took a yellow crayon and drew more. 
“This is my cookie,”
Mamta said. 
“It fell out of my lunch box when I tripped.”


With a purple crayon, Mamta drew a bird. 
In the bird's mouth was Mamta's cookie. 
“Then a bird stole my cookie!”
said Mamta. 
“I wanted to eat that cookie,”
she said. 


Then Mamta drew a picture of her teacher. 
“Miss Laxmi helped me up. 
She gave me her cookie from her lunch.”


Mamta's father smiled. 
“See? 
Your day wasn't all bad,”
he said. 
“And look! 
You are a very good artist!” 


Mamta smiled. 
She forgot to be mad and kept drawing. 
She drew the flowers she had scowled at. 
She drew their bicycle and a tree and a frog. 
Maybe it would be a good day after all.
