Our Cow


This is my village.This is our cow.I take care of our cow.Father and I feed our cow.I give our cow water.I give our cow treats. 
She likes carrots.Father milks our cow every day.Father pours the milk into bottles and pails.We sell some of the milk for money.I get to drink some milk, too.We buy books with the money. 
I like to read books about cows.
