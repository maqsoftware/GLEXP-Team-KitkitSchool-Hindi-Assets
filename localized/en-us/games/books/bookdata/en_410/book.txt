Night Animals


It was nighttime and the animals were sleeping. 
The sky was clear and the moon was shining bright.  But the bright moonlight woke up the dog.        	The dog thought it was time to play. 
He ran around the field under the moonlight.The dog met a firefly. 
The dog was happy to see her awake. 
He told the firefly,
“You are not sleeping. 
Let’s go and play.”He found that a bat was awake too. 
He told the bat,
“Let’s go play.”He ran around and saw a fox. 
He asked the fox to come play with him.The dog approached an owl in a tree. 
He was happy to see the owl awake. 
He asked the owl to play with him.He found that a cricket was awake too. 
He asked the cricket to play with him.The dog didn’t know that some animals do not sleep at night. 
“We sometimes sleep during the day instead. 
We are nocturnal animals,”
they all said.But soon the dog was tired. 
He went back to his mom. Finally, the dog fell fast asleep.
