A Rainy Birthday


Today is Bear’s birthday. 
Bear and his friend Isha are very happy.


Isha sings a birthday song to bear. 
Bear makes a birthday wish. 
He blows out the candles on the cake. 

Suddenly rain starts to fall.


And suddenly fish start to fall from the sky! 
Bear is so happy. 
He tries to catch the fish in a basket to eat later. 


Isha is not happy though. 
The water reaches Leila’s waist. 
Isha is afraid.


Bear carries Isha on his back so the water doesn’t wash her away. 
“Can you make a different birthday wish next year, Bear?”
She asks.
