Lion and Elephant


Lion was the king of the savanna. 
He kept order amongst the animals.One day, as the sun baked the earth, a truck rumbled across the savanna. 
When the truck stopped, two humans led Elephant out of the truck. 
They left Elephant in her new home.“Welcome to the savanna,”
said Lion. 
“Look around and meet the other animals. 
Have a drink at the watering hole.”Elephant went to the watering hole. 
Giraffe told her about the different types of trees and shrubs in the grassland. 
Elephant told her new friends about the humans who took care of her when she was sick.In the evening, Elephant was thirsty. 
She went back to the watering hole. 
When she tried to get a drink, several frogs got in her way. 
She accidentally stepped on two of them.Lion summoned Elephant to his log. 
“You are very large,”
he said. 
“You must be careful of the frogs, because they are very small.”That night, Elephant went to the watering hole again. 
“I am sorry I hurt you before,”
she told the frogs. 
“I will be careful from now on.”When the sun rose, Lion went to the watering hole. 
The frogs told him about Elephant's apology. 
Lion sat on his log and smiled. 
All was right in the savanna.
