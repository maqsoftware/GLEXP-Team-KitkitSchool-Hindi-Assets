Bheem and the Dancing Dinosaur


Bheem looked across the dry desert. 
“The desert is so large,”
he said.


Bheem a song. 
“The desert has room for a dancing dinosaur,”
he sang.
A dinosaur came up beside him. 
Bheem must have been dreaming! 


“I sang for a dinosaur,”
he said. 
“Now let us sing for rain!”


Bheem and the dinosaur sang and danced. 
“Rain, rain, come today.”


Together they sang and danced up a storm.


Bheem and the dinosaur enjoyed the rain.


“I love the rain,”
said Bheem. 
“I love my dancing dinosaur.”
