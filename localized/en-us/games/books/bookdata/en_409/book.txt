A dinosaur came up beside him. 
Shaaban must have been dreaming! 


“I sang for a dinosaur,”
he said. 
“Now let us sing for rain!”


Shaaban and the dinosaur sang and danced. 
“Rain, rain, come today.”


Together they sang and danced up a storm.


Shaaban and the dinosaur enjoyed the rain.


“I love the rain,”
said Shaaban. 
“I love my dancing dinosaur.”
