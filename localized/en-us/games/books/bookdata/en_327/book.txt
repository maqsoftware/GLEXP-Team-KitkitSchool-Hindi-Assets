In The Forest


Fatima used balloons to float up to the sky.


Fatima and her balloons scared a squirrel.
The squirrel lost its book.


Fatima landed on the ground. 
She was sad to scare the squirrel.


She gave a hair tie to the squirrel. 
They became friends.


They played and climbed on the trees.


They surprised a frog resting on the tree.


Later, they sat on the branch to rest.


Fatima became friends with more animals. 
They explored the wonders of the forest.
