The Confident Fawn


A fawn was running in the forest. He ran faster than the rabbit. 
The fawn was so proud.He ran faster than the elephant. 
The fawn was very proud.  He jumped confidently over the stream. 
The fawn wanted to run faster.  He ran past a crumbling wall. There was a large rock on the grassy ground. 
The fawn tripped. He hurt his leg. 
He burst into heavy tears. The monkey tried to help fix his leg. 
The fawn cried and cried.  The bear tried to help pick him up. 
The fawn could not stop crying.His mother came and gave him a hug. 
Finally, the fawn stopped crying. 
He needs to be more careful when he runs.
