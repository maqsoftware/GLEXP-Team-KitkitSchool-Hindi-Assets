How Can I Get to School?


Cindy was late for school. 
She ran to catch the bus, but it had already passed her street. 
Cindy yelled for the driver to stop, but the driver didn't hear.“How can I get to school?”
Cindy asked herself.A boy rode past Cindy on a bicycle. 
He was moving fast as he raced down the street.“If only I had a bicycle,”
Cindy thought. 
“I could ride the bicycle to school. 
I would get there so quickly. 
I might even get there before the bus.”
But Cindy didn't have a bicycle.Then, a truck passed Cindy. 
“If only I had a truck,”
Cindy thought. 
“I could learn to drive and drive to school.”Cindy didn't have a truck, though. 
Cindy also didn't know how to drive. 
She was too young to drive.In the distance, Cindy heard the sound of a train. 
She tried to look and saw a train riding down the tracks. 
It was far away, but if she ran, she might catch it. 
Could the train take Cindy to school?Cindy thought about it. 
The train tracks didn't go near Cindy's school. 
Who knows where that train would go? 
Cindy couldn't get to school on the train.An airplane flew across the sky above. 
That was it! 
Cindy could take an airplane to school. 
She just needs to ask the pilot to take her to school.Cindy waved but the pilot did not see her. 
Then Cindy remembered that airplanes could only land at airports. 
There was no airport near her. 
Too bad!What about a helicopter? 
A helicopter flew past and Cindy remembered that helicopters don't need to land at airports.In a helicopter, Cindy could fly above the bus. 
She would get to school first! 
Too bad Cindy didn't know anyone who had a helicopter.“What about a boat?”
Cindy thought. 
If Cindy's school was near the water, Cindy could get there on a boat.Cindy's school wasn't near the water, though. 
A boat couldn't take Cindy to school, either. 
"How can I get to school?,”
Cindy asked herself again.“I know! 
I'll take a motorcycle!”
Cindy shouted. 
“All I need is a motorcycle.”
