How Can I Get to School?


Shipra was late for school. 
She ran to catch the bus, but it had already passed her street. 
Shipra yelled for the driver to stop, but the driver didn't hear.

"How can I get to school?”
Shipra asked herself.


A boy past Shipra on a bicycle.
He was moving fast as he raced down the street.
"If only I had a bicycle,”
Shipra thought. Shipra
“I could ride the bicycle to school. 
I would get there so quickly. 
I might even get there before the bus.”Shipra
But Shipra didn't have a bicycle.

Then, a truck passed Shipra. 
"If only I had a truck,”
Shipra thought.
“I could learn to drive and drive to school.”


Shipra didn't have a truck, though.
Shipra also didn't know how to drive. 
She was too young to drive.

In the distance, Shipra heard the sound of a train. 
She tried to look and saw a train riding down the tracks. 
It was far away, but if she ran, she might catch it. 
Could the train take Shipra to school?

Shipra thought about it. 
The train tracks didn't go near Shipra's school. 
Who knows where that train would go? 
Shipra couldn't get to school on the train.


An airplane flew across the sky above. 
That was it! 
Shipra could take an airplane to school. 
She just needs to ask the pilot to take her to school.


Shipra waved but the pilot did not see her. 
Then Shipra remembered that airplanes could only land at airports. 
There was no airport near her. 
Too bad!


What about a helicopter? 
A helicopter flew past and Shipra remembered that helicopters don't need to land at airports.


In a helicopter, Shipra could fly above the bus. 
She would get to school first! 
Too bad Shipra didn't know anyone who had a helicopter.


“What about a boat?”
Shipra thought. 
If Shipra's school was near the water, Shipra could get there on a boat.


Shipra's school wasn't near the water, though. 
A boat couldn't take Shipra to school, either. 
"How can I get to school?,”
Shipra asked herself again.


“I know! 
I'll take a motorcycle!”
Shipra shouted. 
“All I need is a motorcycle.”
