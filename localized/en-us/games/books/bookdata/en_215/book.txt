Cats EverywhereCats can be big or small.Cats can have stripes.Cats can have spots.Cats can live in trees.Cats can live on mountains.Some cats like the sun.Some cats like the moon.Some cats have long ears.Some cats are scary.But all cats like to play.And all cats like mice!
