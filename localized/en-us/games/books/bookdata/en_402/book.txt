Playing


My friends and I like to play.


Geeta plays football. 
She has a strong kick.

Muskan goes swimming. 
She swims far.


Sachin plays hide-and-seek. 
Who will find him?


Sangeeta likes to read. 
She can read all day long.


I ask them,
“Can I play with you?”


Geeta and I play football. 
I pass her the ball.


Muskan and I swim. 
I splash her.


Sachin and I play hide-and-seek. 
I find him behind the tree.


Sangeeta reads to me. 
We talk about her book.


Sometimes we all play together. 
We play football.


We play in the cool water.


We play hide-and-seek.


We read together.


I like to play! 
Do you?
