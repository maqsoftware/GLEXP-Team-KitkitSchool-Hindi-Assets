Muskan goes swimming. 
She swims far.


Sachin plays hide-and-seek. 
Who will find him?


Virat likes to read. 
She can read all day long.


I ask them,
“Can I play with you?”


Judy and I play football. 
I pass her the ball.


Muskan and I swim. 
I splash her.


Sachin and I play hide-and-seek. 
I find him behind the tree.


Virat reads to me. 
We talk about her book.


Sometimes we all play together. 
We play football.


We play in the cool water.


We play hide-and-seek.


We read together.


I like to play!
