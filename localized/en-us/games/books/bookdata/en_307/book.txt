A Letter for My Friend


I need paper.I need a pencil.I write a letter to my friend.I need an envelope. 
I put the letter in the envelope. I write her address on the envelope.I put on a stamp on the envelope.I bring the letter in the envelope to the mailbox.My friend got her letter!
