The Mouse and the Lion


Mouse was hungry. 
He looked for food among the grass.He found Lion instead! 
Lion was hungry, too.Lion roared. 
Mouse said,
“Please, Lion. 
Do not eat me.”Mouse said,
“Let me go. Someday, I will help you.” Lion said,
“That is silly. 
How can a little mouse help me? 
But you may go.”A few days later, Lion got stuck. 
Wire was twisted around his legs. “Help,”
Lion cried. 
“I am trapped!”Mouse rushed back. 
He said,
“I can use my teeth. 
You will be free.”Lion said,
“Thank you, Mouse. 
You are little, but you are a good friend.”
