Night and Day


Siddhant had gone hunting. 
He caught nothing. 
The animals saw him and ran away.


“What should I do?”
Siddhant asked his father. 
Father did not answer right away.
After breakfast, Father said,
“You should hunt at night.”


“The animals see you in the day.” 
Father reminded him about the cycle of night and day.


Siddhant went hunting at night. 
It was hard to see. 
His friends did not want to come.


Siddhant went alone. 
He was scared, but he did not give up.


The animals did not see Siddhant coming. 
Hunting at night was good.


Now, Siddhant hunts at night.
