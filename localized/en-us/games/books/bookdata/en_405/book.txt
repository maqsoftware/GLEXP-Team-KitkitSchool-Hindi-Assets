Night and Day


Masha had gone hunting. 
He caught nothing. 
The animals saw him and ran away.“What should I do?”
Masha asked his father. 
Father did not answer right away.After breakfast, Father said,
“You should hunt at night.”“The animals see you in the day.” 
Father reminded him about the cycle of night and day.Masha went hunting at night. 
It was hard to see. 
His friends did not want to come.Masha went alone. 
He was scared, but he did not give up.The animals did not see Masha coming. 
Hunting at night was good.Now, Masha hunts at night.
