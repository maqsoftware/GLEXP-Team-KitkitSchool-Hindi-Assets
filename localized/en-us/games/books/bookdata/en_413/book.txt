To the Moon!


Once there was a boy named Kartik and a girl named Rani. 
One day Kartik and Rani decided to go to the moon.

“What kind of food should we eat on the moon?”
Rani asked John.Kartik


“We can bring melons to eat on the moon. 
We will eat them with a spoon.”
John said to Rani.


John and Rani packed a melon and a spoon. 
Now they needed a way to get to the moon.


John and Rani built rocket boots with some tools. 
Their boots shot them up to the moon.


John and Rani got to the moon and rolled and rolled down white sand dunes.


They ate their breakfast of melon with a spoon. 
That put them both in a good mood.


After they ate, they took a snooze and woke up to hear a space owl say,
“Hoot! Hoot!”


John and Rani knew they must be home soon. 
So they put on their rocket boots and left the moon.


They landed back at home around noon. 
And for lunch they ate soup and watched their mule.


How would you like to go to the moon, too?
