To the Moon!


Once there was a boy named Kartik and a girl named Rani. 
One day Kartik and Rani decided to go to the moon.

“What should we bring with us?”
Kartik asked Rani. 
Rani said,
We will need to bring some food.”

“What kind of food should we eat on the moon?”
Rani asked Kartik.


“We can bring melons to eat on the moon. 
We will eat them with a spoon.”
Kartik said to Rani.


Kartik and Rani packed a melon and a spoon. 
Now they needed a way to get to the moon.


Kartik and Rani built rocket boots with some tools. 
Their boots shot them up to the moon.


Kartik and Rani got to the moon and rolled and rolled down white sand dunes.


They ate their breakfast of melon with a spoon. 
That put them both in a good mood.


After they ate, they took a snooze and woke up to hear a space owl say,
“Hoot! Hoot!”


Kartik and Rani knew they must be home soon. 
So they put on their rocket boots and left the moon.


They landed back at home around noon. 
And for lunch they ate soup and watched their mule.


How would you like to go to the moon, too?
