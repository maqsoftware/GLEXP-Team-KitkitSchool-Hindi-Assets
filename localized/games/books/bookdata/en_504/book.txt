Don’t Give Up!


In the morning, Fox went for a walk. 
He walked until the sun was high. 
His stomach rumbled with hunger. He looked all around for something to eat. 
He saw some grapes high in a tree. 
They must be so sweet! 
How could he get them?Fox reached with his arms. 
He could almost taste the grapes! 
He jumped as high as he could. 
He tried to grab the grapes.Fox fell to the ground. 
He held nothing in his paws. 
The grapes looked very far away.He jumped again. 
He grabbed for the bunch of grapes. 
He got close, but he still could not reach them.Fox could not get the grapes by jumping. 
He was getting upset. 
Could he find another way?We will never know because Fox stopped trying. 
He made an excuse to give up. 
“I do not want those grapes anyway,”
he pretended. 
“I bet they taste sour.”But excuses do not fix problems. 
Fox walked away feeling sad, mad, and still hungry.
