Lucy’s Walk


Every morning, Lucy thinks about the plants she will see on the walk to school.She thinks about the fruit trees she will greet. 
Maybe she will get to eat some fruit.On the way to school, Lucy walks through a field of flowers. 
She picks a pretty pink flower.Lucy takes a deep breath through her nose. 
The flower smells sweet.Lucy sits down in the field. 
Pretty flowers are all around her. 
She feels happy.Lucy passes a fruit tree. 
The fruits on the tree are green. 
The fruits are not ripe yet.“Get ripe soon,”
Lucy tells the fruit. 
“I am hungry!”Lucy greets the tree at school. 
She is glad that sunshine and rain make the plants grow. 
When Lucy eats oranges, she grows, too.
