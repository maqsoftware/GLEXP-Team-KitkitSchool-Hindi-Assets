Time and the Sun


A clock tells the time.  
The short hand points to the hour, the long hand points to the minute.When the short hand points to 6 in the morning, the sun is waking up.When the short hand points to 9 in the morning, the sun is rising.When the short hand points to 12 at noon, the sun is high in the sky.When the short hand points to 3 in the afternoon, the sun is setting.When the short hand points to 6 at night, the sun has gone to sleep.
