A Rainy Birthday


Today is Bear’s birthday. 
Bear and his friend Leila are very happy.Leila sings a birthday song to bear. 
Bear makes a birthday wish. 
He blows out the candles on the cake. Suddenly rain starts to fall.And suddenly fish start to fall from the sky! 
Bear is so happy. 
He tries to catch the fish in a basket to eat later. Leila is not happy though. 
The water reaches Leila’s waist. 
Leila is afraid.Bear carries Leila on his back so the water doesn’t wash her away. 
“Can you make a different birthday wish next year, Bear?”
She asks.
