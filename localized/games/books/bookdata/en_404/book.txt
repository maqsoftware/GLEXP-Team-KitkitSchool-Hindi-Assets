Nia and the Dirt Monsters


Nia goes outside to play.Nia plays with her boat in the rain. 
She gets dirty.She makes a castle out of sand. 
She gets dirtier.Mother says,
“You are too dirty! 
Take this soap and get clean.”Nia says,
“I don't want to wash.”
She kicks the soap.That night, she dreams she is a princess. 
Dirt monsters attack the castle!The dirt and bugs are all around her. 
Nia tries to run away.Super Soap comes to save the day! 
“I will clean up the monsters,”
he says. Super Soap sends out bubbles. 
The bubbles chase away the bugs and dirt.In the morning, Mother gives Nia soap. 
Nia says,
“Now I like to wash.”Nia goes outside to play. 
She will wash with soap when she gets home!
