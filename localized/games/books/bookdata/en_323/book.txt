Big Elephant and Small Rabbit


Elephant and Rabbit were best friends.  
They loved to play together.One day, Rabbit said,
“Let’s play a game. 
I will jump on your back!”Rabbit jumped high onto elephant’s back. 
“That was fun!”
said Rabbit.“Now it is my turn!”
said Elephant.  
“I will jump on your back.”“No, you can’t!”
Rabbit said. 
“You are too big. 
You will crush me!”That made Elephant sad.  
She stomped until the trees shook. 
Coconuts fell on her. “I’m sorry,”
Rabbit said. 
“I should have picked a game we could both play.”“Next time we can pick a game together!”
Rabbit said. 
Elephant liked that idea.
