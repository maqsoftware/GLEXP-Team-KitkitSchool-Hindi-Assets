Can We Be Friends?


I am all alone.Why am I alone?Can anyone hear me?I don't care if you are big or small. 
I want to be your friend.I hear the other animals laugh.I call to the other animals.“Let us play together,”
I say.I do not want to eat alone.I do not want to play alone.I look for friends everywhere.Will you be my friends?I do not want to be alone.It is more fun with friends. 
Thank you for being my friend!
