From Head to Foot


This is your head. 
This is your hair.This is your ear. 
This is your face.Here is your neck.Here are our shoulders.This is your stomach.This is your chest.This is your hand.These are our hands.These are our knees.This is my foot. 
Where is your foot?Here is your foot.
