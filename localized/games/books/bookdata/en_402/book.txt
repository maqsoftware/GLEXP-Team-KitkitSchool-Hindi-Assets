Playing


My friends and I like to play.Judy plays football. 
She has a strong kick.Kelly goes swimming. 
She swims far.David plays hide-and-seek. 
Who will find him?Faith likes to read. 
She can read all day long.I ask them,
“Can I play with you?”Judy and I play football. 
I pass her the ball.Kelly and I swim. 
I splash her.David and I play hide-and-seek. 
I find him behind the tree.Faith reads to me. 
We talk about her book.Sometimes we all play together. 
We play football.We play in the cool water.We play hide-and-seek.We read together.I like to play! 
Do you?
