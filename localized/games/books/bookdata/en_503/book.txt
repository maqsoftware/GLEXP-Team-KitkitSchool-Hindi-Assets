Don’t Get Mad, Maddie


School ended and all the boys and girls ran outside. 
Everyone laughed and played except for Maddie. 
Maddie was mad! Maddie's father smiled as he took Maddie home through a field of flowers on his bicycle. 
But Maddie didn't smile at the pretty flowers. 
Maddie was so mad! When they got home, Maddie's father waved hello to the monkeys on the roof. 
Maddie didn't say hello. 
Maddie was mad. 
She scowled at the monkeys. 
Maddie yelled,
“Get off our house!" Maddie's father tried to make his daughter feel better. 
“Here, Maddie,”
he said,
“drink some nice cool milk.”
“I don't want any,”
Maddie yelled. 
But Maddie drank the milk anyway. 
Maddie felt a little less mad. “How about a sweet snack?”
asked Maddie's father. 
“No, no, no!”
shouted Maddie. 
But her father gave her something to eat anyway. 
Maddie ate the sweet and felt a little better. “Why are you so unhappy, Maddie?”
Maddie's father asked. 
“Are you hurt?”
he asked. 
“No,”
said Maddie. 
“I'm MAD! 
I had a bad day at school.”"Can you tell me what happened?”
Maddie's father asked. 
“I don't want to,”
said Maddie. 
“Can you draw what happened?”
he asked. 
Maddie's father handed Maddie some crayons. First, she drew a red block. 
“This,”
she explained,
“is the brick I tripped over on my way to lunch.”Next, Maddie took a green crayon. 
She drew a picture of a boy. 
“This,”
explained Maddie,
“is the mean boy who laughed at me when I fell down!”Maddie took a yellow crayon and drew more. 
“This is my cookie,”
Maddie said. 
“It fell out of my lunch box when I tripped.”With a purple crayon, Maddie drew a bird. 
In the bird's mouth was Maddie's cookie. 
“Then a bird stole my cookie!”
said Maddie. 
“I wanted to eat that cookie,”
she said. Then Maddie drew a picture of her teacher. 
“Miss Anna helped me up. 
She gave me her cookie from her lunch.”Maddie's father smiled. 
“See? 
Your day wasn't all bad,”
he said. 
“And look! 
You are a very good artist!” Maddie smiled. 
She forgot to be mad and kept drawing. 
She drew the flowers she had scowled at. 
She drew their bicycle and a tree and a frog. 
Maybe it would be a good day after all.
